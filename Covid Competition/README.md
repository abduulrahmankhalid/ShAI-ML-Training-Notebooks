**The primary objective of this project was to classify Chest X-ray images and provide accurate diagnoses for patients.**
- Initially, we developed a conventional CNN model that demonstrated exceptional performance.

-  However, in our pursuit of achieving even higher scores, we explored the potential of transfer learning by incorporating pre-trained models such as DenseNet, InceptionNet, and VGG.

-   Through extensive experimentation, we successfully improved our model's performance and secured the third position among 30 participating teams in the competition.
